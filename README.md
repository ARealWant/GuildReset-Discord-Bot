💣 Guildbomb is a simple discord-bot, which shows you how easy it can be to raid a discord-server within one minute, so everybody will be banned, all emojis will be deleted, all invites will be deleted, every role and every channel too..

## What's the Guildbomb Bot?
The Guildbomb Bot is a raid bot with a simple configuration, inspired from the [innocent bot](https://github.com/Da532/Innocent-bot) by Da532.

## Why did you code this?
It's one of my first projects tbh, I published the Guildbomb to show everyone how easy it can be to raid discord-servers
Discord raids aren't that rare, that's the reason why I also published an [Antiraid Bot which's called Crowby](https://crowby.me/)

## Should I raid others with the Guildbomb Bot?
**NO.** I really advise against it, raiding others is against the Discord TOS so please, **don't do it.**

## You want to test the Guildbomb Bot?
Alright, you can do that. But please use an alt-account AND [create a template](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041033511-Server-Templates#:~:text=Creating%20a%20Server%20Template,-Note%3A%20This%20feature&text=After%20you%20fill%20out%20the,to%20share%20your%20Server%20Template!), you can use templates from [this website](https://discord.style/) for example.

#### Some templates you could use for example:
- https://discord.style/template?id=1
- https://discord.style/template?id=7
- https://discord.style/template?id=48
- https://discord.style/template?id=50
- https://discord.style/template?id=193

## Let's start:
1. Be sure, that every change and damage happened, using the Guildbomb Bot will be absolutly YOUR fault.
2. Login in to an alt-account and go to [Discord's Developerpage](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
3. Create an application now, go to the Category "Bot" in your created application and copy the BOT-TOKEN, you'll need that later.
4. And go to the category "Bot" in your application and then enable Privileged Gateway Intents "Presence Intent" and "Server Members Intent"
5. After you downloaded the Guildbomb Bot, open/edit the *data.py*, you'll find this file in the *UtilsDirectory*.
6. Put your Bot-Token instead of the "X" in and change the prefix if you want to use another one.
7. Now invite the Bot with clicking [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=ID&scope=bot&permissions=8)
and change ID to your Bot-ID, you'll find this on the Discord Developers Website.
8. After you invited the Bot to your discord-server (hopely a template-server), you can easily just start the *mainbomb.py*.

## The Bot Usage:
